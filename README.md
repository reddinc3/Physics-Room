# Physics Room

My project is going to be a physics room in which the user has complete control over the laws of physics.

The project will be a web browser application that will be written in Three.js.

The application is intended to be helpful to secondary school students studying physics related exam questions.

The user is presented with a 3D world containing objects which the user is able to launch. How the object behaves after it has been launched is dertermined by how the user set the laws of physics to apply.
